Parallel Tracking and Multiple Mapping (PTAMM) README
-----------------------------------------------------
* In this branch we focus on Linux setups only, therefore:
** V4L feed is the only in use
** Hard-coded LINKING flags assuming the required libs are in /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib
** Changed includes, to respect GNU compilers suggestions (unist.h was missing)
** Re-factored Model3ds to compile against newer lib3ds (not-tested)

NB! this is development branch, the code might still broken

Please see the manual.pdf for complete installation and usage instructions.
